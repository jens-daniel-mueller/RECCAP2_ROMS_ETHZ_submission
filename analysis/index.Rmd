On this website we present some initial analysis of the CESM-ROMS model output submitted to RECCAP2-ocean.

Please navigate trough the navbar on top to take a look at the various chapters of this analysis. The links in the upper right corner bring you to the source code of this project and back to Jens' main homepage.
